## 📖 Introduction
Greetings! I am TaeJun Park, a Master's student at Hongik University. My research interests lie broadly in Computer Architecture and AI Accelerators. I started this repository to archive short reviews on the papers I study.

### 💟 Special Thanks
This repository is greatly inspired by the lectures and research of **[Prof. Onur Mutlu]** (ETH Zürich).  
Most of the papers(Computer Architecture) listed here were recommended and studied through his excellent courses on DDCA and [ACA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I-JOd51ctA&list=PL5Q2soXY2Zi8tTLVb-9CUHcfKXLWESjOD)
